# CS-230
This is the journal entry for week 8 of CS-230 at SNHU



Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    -The Game Room client was a company that had a successful app and they wanted to expand the reach to other operating systems. They had an Android app called "Draw it or Lose it" and were looking to have a version developed for browsers on computers. They also wanted us to help develop a server configuration so that players could connect to the game on their browsers.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    -I think that I explained my reasoning behind why I was doing what I was doing and that I wrote everything so that people that aren't part of this class/company can read and understand my points. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    -I found that understanding what I was doing and why I was doing it helped me. Seeing everything out in front of me, written in plain english, was a very beneficial.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    -It's hard to choose one thing to revise, as everytime I look at my own work I find small things that didn't make sense or that I think I can explain/execute better. I would probably choose the first chunk of information that I had to write, as I was still trying to understand the assingment and what I needed to write and what was expected of me.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    -I tried to interpret them as plain as they said them. If they needed the server to shut off every 5 minutes I would write about how I was gonna do that. It's important to consider their needs as you are just doing a job. Unless you are part of the main company and their decision making process there shouldn't really be much room for you to say "hey, I don't agree with what you want me to do" (unless it's unethical).
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    -I approached it the same way I would any assignment, making sure I understood what was expected and trying to finish everything to the best of my abilities. In the future I would probably use the same techniques that I used today so that I have a template of requirements that I can pull from. This will help me to grow my skills and to develop better documents each time I need to write one.
